   <h1> Introduction to Research Methods. The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing</h1>

This unit introduced the scientific ways of research and highlighted the importance of ethical issues in research. The unit helped me differentiate between the inductive and deductive reasoning in broader since. 


<h2>E portfolio Activity 1 (Discussion Topic: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct)</h2>

<h3>Case Study</h3> The unapproved acquisition and use of Facebook user data to sway political campaigns occurred during the Cambridge Analytica data leak.
<h4>Code of Ethics for ACM</h4>
<Ul>
A framework for assessing the moral implications of computing professionals' behavior is provided by the ACM Code of Ethics. In the Cambridge Analytica case, multiple concepts are important, including:
<li><strong>Public Good:</strong>   The breach jeopardized the privacy of millions of Facebook users, potentially damaging their well-being.</li>
<li>Honesty and Trust: Regarding their methods for gathering and using data, Facebook and Cambridge Analytica fell short of being truthful and open.</li>
<li>Fairness: Some populations were disproportionately impacted by the breach, which raises questions about equity and fairness.</li>
<li>Accountability: Through inquiries and court cases, Facebook and Cambridge Analytica were both made to answer for their deeds.</li></Ul>
<h4>BCS Code of Conduct</h4>
 
<Ul>
This code of conduct offers computing professionals additional ethical standards. The fundamental values of the ACM and BCS codes—public good, honesty, justice, and accountability—may differ in certain ways, but overall they are similar. In light of the data leak at Cambridge Analytica, the BCS Code of Conduct probably would have demanded:
<li>Respect for the law: Data protection laws and other pertinent laws may have been broken by the breach.</li>	
<li>Professional competence: It's possible that the experts engaged in the data breach did not handle sensitive data with the appropriate level of professionalism.</li>
<li>Integrity: Facebook and Cambridge Analytica's activities went against the moral precepts of honesty and integrity.</li>
</Ul>
<h4>Implications for Ethics</h4>

The Cambridge Analytica data leak brought attention to the possibility of personal information being misused on social networking sites. It sparked debate over the necessity of stricter data privacy laws as well as the scope of businesses' obligations to secure user data.
<h4>Legal and Social Consequences</h4>
Due to the hack, Facebook and Cambridge Analytica were the target of legal activities, and their data policies came under closer scrutiny. Significant social ramifications also resulted from the incident, which highlighted worries about the possibility of targeted disinformation efforts and revealed the fragility of people's personal information.
<h4>Professional Impact</h4>
The scandal had a negative impact on the reputation of both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. It has led to demands for higher ethical responsibility from computing experts who gather and process data.

           <h2 >E portfolio activity 2 (Analyzing the Generative AI Revolution: A Call for Global Governance)</h2> 

<p>Deckard (2023) and Correa et al. (2023) highlight the profound effects of generative AI on a number of disciplines, most notably computer science. AI is not new in and of itself, but its current explosion, sometimes referred to as a "renaissance," calls for new governance guidelines.
    Correa et al. draw attention to the difficulty in reaching a worldwide agreement on AI values because of the differing viewpoints of stakeholders and the abstract character of normative language. They support the development of tools to categorize and contrast AI governance documents in order to find similarities and differences.</p>

<h4>A Proposed Course of Action: A Global AI Governance Framework</h4>
<p>A worldwide framework for AI governance is essential given the global nature of AI and its possible social ramifications. This structure ought to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
	<p> <strong>Establish Core values:</strong> Human rights, ethics, and the welfare of society should be the foundation of these values. As examples, consider:</p>
<ul>	<li> <strong>Accountability and Transparency:</strong> AI systems ought to be open and honest about how they arrive at decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Fairness and Non-Discrimination:</strong> AI shouldn't support prejudice or discrimination that already exists.</li>
<li><strong>oPrivacy and Data Protection:</strong> Users' data and privacy should be protected by strong safeguards.</li>
<li><strong>Safety and Security:</strong> AI systems ought to be built with the least amount of risk and the intention of avoiding negative consequences.</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Encourage International Cooperation:</strong> To promote international cooperation on AI governance, a worldwide organization should be established, maybe operating under the United Nations' auspices. This group would: o Develop Standards: Establish uniform policies for the advancement and application of AI.</p>
<ul>	<li>Encourage Knowledge Sharing: Encourage the sharing of research and best practices.</li>
<li>Face Global Challenges: Work together to solve problems like AI-powered misinformation and self-driving weaponry.</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Promote Ethical AI Development:</strong> Institutions of higher learning, research centers, and businesses should incorporate ethical issues into AI research and instruction. This comprises:</p>
<ul><li>Ethical Impact Assessments: Analyzing possible ethical ramifications of AI initiatives through assessments.</li>
<li>Ethical Guidelines: Creating and following moral standards for the advancement of AI.</li>	</ul></li>
</ol>

<h4>Impact on Legal, Social, and Professional Issues</h4>

<p>The following would happen if a worldwide AI governance structure were implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal:</strong> It would give regulation of AI a solid legal basis, covering matters such as consumer protection, liability, and intellectual property.</li>
<li> <strong>Social: </strong>Social: It might assist in reducing the possible adverse effects of AI on society, like loss of jobs, invasions of privacy, and biased judgment.</li>
<li> <strong>Professional:</strong> It would create a framework that computer experts could use to create and use AI in an ethical and responsible manner.</li></ul>
<p>We can maximize the potential advantages of generative AI while lowering its risks and making sure it works best for humanity by establishing a worldwide framework for AI governance.</p>
