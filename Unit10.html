 <h4> <strong>Personal Reflection on the research proposal prepared:</strong> </h4> <br><br>
 <p>
The study proposal's main goal was to investigate how AI assistant technology might benefit the elderly and physically challenged. The proposal described an all-encompassing strategy to look into this problem through a thorough evaluation of the literature and careful consideration of research methodologies.<br><br>
I have gained a deeper awareness of the complexity involved in doing research thanks to the process of drafting the study proposal. It helped me to hone my research question, pinpoint important topics to look into, and choose the best methodology.<br><br>
One of the most important lessons learned from this experience was the value of conducting research in a methodical and well-organized manner. The readings on research writing and reporting offered insightful information about the essential elements and structure of a dissertation.<br><br>
All things considered, this course has given me the information and abilities I need to confidently start the dissertation writing process. Building on the groundwork laid forth in the study proposal, I am equipped to learn more about the subject and make a valuable contribution to the assistive technology community.<br><br>

</p>
<p>Presenting a research question's solution based on investigation, analysis, interpretation, and argument is known as research writing.</p>
<p>An extensive and comprehensive academic work that summarizes the findings of original study on a particular subject or question is called a dissertation.</p>
<p>Parts of a dissertation include: </p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> A synopsis of the subject and research inquiry</li>
    <li><strong>Review of literature:</strong> An analysis and appraisal of earlier studies</li>
    <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> Describes the procedures used to gather and examine data.</li>
    <li><strong>Results:</strong> Synopsis of the study's conclusions.</li>
    <li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Analysis of findings and their significance</li>
</ol>
