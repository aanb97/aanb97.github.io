            <p>
                The 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal made the possibility of survey data exploitation on social media sites visible. Through what appeared to be harmless personality tests, the firm was able to gather personal information from millions of Facebook users. The 2016 U.S. presidential election saw the creation of tailored political ads using this data in an effort to sway voter behavior.<br><br>

Serious moral, legal, and social questions were brought up by the controversy. The use of personal information for manipulative objectives and without informed consent is extremely problematic from an ethical perspective. The event brought to light the significance of data privacy and the requirement for more stringent laws to safeguard personal data.<br><br>

<strong>In terms of society,</strong> the Cambridge Analytica incident made clear how elections and public opinion may be influenced by deliberate disinformation efforts. The integrity of information systems and democratic processes are significantly impacted by this.<br><br>
<strong>Legally,</strong> the controversy led to investigations and legal actions against Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. The event called into question the corporations' obligations to preserve user data and their adherence to data protection legislation.<br><br>
The controversy has significantly affected the data science and analytics community on a professional level. It has sparked calls for more ethical accountability among data professionals and enhanced scrutiny of data collecting and usage practices.<br><br>

            <h4>Additional instances of improper survey use are: </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Market research companies that obtain private, sensitive data without the required authorization. Identity theft, discrimination, and other negative outcomes may result from this. </li>
                <li>Government organizations that employ surveys to get intelligence or surveillance data. This may breach people's right to privacy and erode public confidence in governmental institutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These illustrations highlight how crucial it is to take ethics into account while creating and implementing surveys. It is essential to get people' informed consent, respect their privacy, and handle data appropriately. If this isn't done, there may be detrimental effects on people, groups, and society at large. </p>
