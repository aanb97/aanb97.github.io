        <div> <h1>Unit 7: Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing:</h1>
            <p>
                This unit introduced the concept of inferential statistics, hypothesis testing and the fundamental idea of probability. We were given a set statistical exercise to perform and submit our interpretation of these results.

            <h2>E portfolio Activity (Discussion Topic - Case Study: Accuracy of information)</h2>
            <p>The researcher, Abi, is faced with a serious moral conundrum when examining the statistics for the new cereal, Whizzzz. Important concerns concerning the obligations of researchers and the objectivity of scientific investigation are brought up by the possible conflict between providing correct results and defending the manufacturer's claims.</p>
        <h4>Moral Issues:</h4> 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Manipulation: </strong>  It is categorically immoral for Abi to alter data values in order to get the desired result. This would be considered misconduct in science and damage his research's credibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Selective Analysis:</strong>  Although it's desirable to provide both positive and negative evaluations, this isn't always possible. But it is Abi's duty to present the most accurate and pertinent information. Even if the data supports the favorable results, focusing solely on them could be deceptive and even dangerous.</li>
            <li><strong>Use of Program Results:</strong> Abi bears a moral responsibility to take into account the possible effects of how others use his program outputs, even though he may not be personally accountable for them. He should take action to reduce the risks if he thinks that the results could be abused to hurt customers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Legal, Social, and Professional Impacts:</h4> 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legal:</strong>  Abi may be subject to penalties or even criminal prosecution if he willfully provides false or erroneous data.</li>
            <li><strong>Social:</strong>  Misleading data use may have detrimental effects on society, including harm to consumers and a decline in public confidence in scientific research.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional:</strong> If Abi is discovered to have participated in unethical activities, his standing as a researcher could be seriously jeopardized.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Courses of Action: </h4> 
        <p>In order to resolve this moral conundrum, Abi has the following options:</p> 
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Present Both Sets of Results:</strong>  This is the most moral course of action since it guarantees openness and enables the manufacturer to decide with knowledge. Abi can suggest more study to elucidate the results or look at different perspectives.</li>
            <li><strong>Communicate Concerns:</strong> Abi should voice his concerns and provide documentation of his attempts to ensure accurate and transparent reporting if the manufacturer insists on showcasing just the favorable outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Request External Review:</strong> In order to confirm the precision and objectivity of his analysis, Abi may ask for an outside evaluation of his conclusions.</li>
            <li><strong>Take into Account Whistleblowing:</strong> In severe circumstances, Abi could need to take into account whistleblowing if he feels that the manufacturer's conduct represent a serious harm to the public's health.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Abi can make a judgment that upholds his moral principles and safeguards the integrity of scientific research by carefully weighing the ethical, legal, societal, and professional ramifications of his options.</p>
