            <p>
                This unit helped me develop my knowledge in formulating research question and understanding all the essential parts required for a research proposal.

           <h2 >E portfolio activity (Discuss the framework and outline prepared for developing my research proposal) </h2> 

<p>A methodical approach is required when doing a literature evaluation on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical diagnosis. This is a quick synopsis of the procedure:</p>


<p>A worldwide framework for AI governance is essential given the global nature of AI and its possible social ramifications. This structure ought to:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Outline Your Purpose:</strong> Indicate precisely the area of AI in medical diagnosis you wish to   concentrate on. This could be a specific illness, kind of AI method, or use.</li>
    <li> <strong>Carry Out an Extensive Search:</strong> To locate pertinent research publications, use reliable academic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. To hone your search, use Boolean operators and pertinent keywords.</li>
    <li><strong>Assess the Sources:</strong>  Evaluate each source's quality critically. Take into account elements such as the publication date, author qualifications, and impact factor of the journal.</li>
    <li><strong>Make Notes:</strong>  As you read the papers, make thorough notes on the main conclusions, methods, and findings. Organize your notes into logical framework.</li>
    <li><strong>Examine and Condense:</strong>  Determine recurring themes, patterns, and points of contention in the literature. Examine the ways in which various studies advance our knowledge of artificial intelligence in medical diagnostics.</li>
    <li><strong>Structure Your Review:</strong>  Put your findings in a logical order by creating an outline. Think about using a comparative, thematic, or chronological approach.</li>
    <li><strong>Compose Your Review:</strong> Create a body, introduction, and conclusion that are all very clear. A summary of the subject and your research question ought to be included in the beginning. In the body, you should summarize your research and discuss the main points of contention in the literature. Your primary ideas should be summed up in the conclusion, along with some suggestions for further research.</li>
    <li><strong>Cite Your Sources: </strong>To correctly credit other people's work, use a consistent citation format (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.).</li>
    <li><strong>Edit and Rewrite:</strong> Pay close attention to the grammatical correctness, consistency, and clarity of your review. Make the required changes to raise the standard overall.</li>
