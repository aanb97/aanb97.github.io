        <div> <h1>Unit 3: Methodology and Research Methods.</h1>
            <p>
                This unit helped shape my understanding of the research methods (qualitative , quantitative and mixed method) and choose the suitable approach for my research. The research design descriptive and exploratory question were also explained to better understand the need of my research.
            </p></div>
        
        <div class="content">
           <h2 >E portfolio Activity : 
            Considering your thoughts on research proposal questions for your project:
            <ul>
            <li>Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?</li>
            <li>Which data collection methods would you consider using?</li>
            <li>Which required skills will you need to have or develop for the chosen project?</li>
        </ul></h2> 

<p>It seems like a mixed-methods approach would be best given the study topics. In order to fully comprehend the requirements, difficulties, and possible advantages of artificial intelligence (AI) in assistive devices, both qualitative and quantitative study would be required.
    Some possible techniques for gathering data are as follows:
    </p>



<ul>
    <li><h4><strong>Qualitative:</strong> </h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Semi-structured interviews:</strong>  To get in-depth information on the experiences with present technology and expectations for artificial intelligence from people who are physically challenged, the elderly, and caregivers.</li>
            <li> <strong>Focus groups:</strong> To lead conversations and find themes among participants.</li>
            <li><strong>Observations:</strong> To watch people utilizing assistive technology in practical situations.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h4><strong>Qualitative:</strong></h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Surveys:</strong> To gather information on participant preferences, needs, and views of AI from a broader sample of people.</li>
            <li><strong>Case studies:</strong> To look at particular instances of AI's application in assistive technology.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><h4><strong>The following are the required skills needed for this project:</strong> </h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Research design:</strong> The capacity to create a strategy for the study that answers the research questions and guarantees the reliability and validity of the data.</li>
            <li> <strong>Data collection:</strong> Proficiency in administering surveys, focus groups, and interviews; ability to analyze both quantitative and qualitative data.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical knowledge:</strong> comprehension of assistive and AI technologies, as well as possible uses for them. </li>
            <li><strong>Ethical considerations:</strong>  Being aware of the moral dilemmas that arise when using human subjects in research, particularly when it comes to vulnerable groups.</li>
            <li><strong>Data analysis:</strong>  Able to analyze quantitative data and interpret qualitative findings using statistical tools (e.g., SPSS, R).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>I can perform an extensive and rigorous study to solve the research problems and contribute to the creation of AI-powered assistive technologies that better suit the needs of elderly and physically challenged people by combining these methodologies and capabilities.</p>
